*The State of Museum Digital Practice (2019)* is written, edited and published by students in "Museums and Digital Technology" at George Washington University. In 2019, for the first time, students in the course were responsible for creating a 3,000-4,000-word piece of writing that dives into a specific research area related to the state of museum digital practice today. Student responses can synthesize current readings and practice around a broad area, dive deeper into a single technology or case study, or speak more broadly on the theme of digital practice and its impact on the museum. There is room for experimentation in form, content and style, so long as there is internal consistency between topic and output format.

Each student is responsible for research, writing and preparing their file using Markdown language.  Each student works with a peer review team across the semester. Suse Anderson, Assistant Professor, Museum Studies, is responsible for the compiled book.
