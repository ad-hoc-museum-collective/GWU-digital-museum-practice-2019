*The State of Museum Digital Practice (2019)* is written, edited and published by students in "Museums and Digital Technology" at George Washington University. Each student in the course was responsible for creating a 3,000-4,000-word piece of writing that dives into a specific research area related to the state of museum digital practice today. Student responses synthesize current readings and practice around a broad area, dive deeper into a single technology or case study, or speak more broadly on the theme of digital practice and its impact on the museum. There was room for experimentation in form, content and style, so long as there was internal consistency between topic and output format.
